# A simple directory for generating names from Andrey Karpathy's videos

This repository mainly consists of notebooks which were inspired by Andrey Karpathy's lectures on backpropagation and neural networks.


Some work realted to CNN and RNN is still pending which can be used to further improve the generation capabilities inside the model.
